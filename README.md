# Discord-bot-discordie
# A discord bot i made when i was younger, it should still work but dependencies must be updated at least.

##this bot was made for my own personal use only, therefor alot of personal datails bot token api keys and the like has been removed
##the bot will not function without these provided

##dependencies
ffmppeg, binary shuld be placed directly in the folder if i remember correctly.


##the bot runs using node and has a couple dependencies
##npm dependenies
npm install discordie  ##the discord api i used
npm install nodemon ##helps development and is not striclty necsarry, if removed the startup command in package.jason must also be changed
npm install youtube-node ##youtube api for node
npm install ytdl-core ##web contend downloader library originaly made for youtube
npm install fluent-ffmpeg ## im not actually sure this one is even used anymore, it may not be needed its a ffmpeg lib for node in any case
